# Unfriendly Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates an example of an unfriendly error message in a MATLAB function and shows how to improve it.

The `bug.m` file contains the original function with the problematic error handling. The `bugSolution.m` file shows an improved version with a more user-friendly error message. 

## Bug Description
The function `myFunction` throws a generic error message when a negative input is provided. This message lacks context and could be improved to provide more information to the user. 

## Solution
The improved function in `bugSolution.m` includes a more descriptive error message that specifies the problem and suggests possible solutions.  This improves the user experience and makes debugging easier.
